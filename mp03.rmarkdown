# üìò Introduction

This mini-project explores a large Spotify playlist dataset and corresponding song characteristics. The goal is to analyze how user-created playlists reflect patterns in music preference and how these patterns align with musical attributes like energy, danceability, and valence.

## üìù Spotify Million Playlist Dataset

Due to ongoing issues with the GitHub repository originally hosting the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (flagged by students and the professor), only a single JSON file mpd.slice.0-999.json was accessible. While this limits broader generalization, the selected slice provides a representative sample to conduct exploratory analysis.

### üìâ Visually Identifying Characteristics of Popular Songs

This section visually explores various aspects of popular Spotify songs. We start by examining the correlation between popularity and playlist appearances, finding a moderate positive relationship. A bar plot of release years highlights the dominance of recent years in shaping user preferences, particularly the top 5% most popular songs.

Danceability peaked in the early 2010s, as shown by a line plot, while a bar plot reveals the 2000s and 2010s as the most represented decades. A polar plot of musical key frequencies shows a balanced distribution, and a histogram indicates a preference for medium-length songs, with shorter tracks slightly more common.

Finally, a scatter plot suggests a slight positive correlation between energy and popularity, and the distribution of valence scores shows that users favor songs with more positive moods.

**1. Is the popularity column correlated with the number of playlist appearances?**

# üì¶ Building a Playlist from Anchor Song

## Finding Related Songs

To build a cohesive playlist, I began by selecting two anchor songs that reflect the desired energy and style. I then used a data-driven approach to generate a list of potential tracks, curated the final playlist, and analyzed its dynamic flow.

**1. Selected Anchor Songs:**

**"Blinding Lights"** by The Weeknd\
**"ROCKSTAR"** (feat. Roddy Ricch) by DaBaby

These anchor songs were selected for their contrasting yet complementary energy profiles. **"Blinding Lights"** has an upbeat synth-driven vibe, while **"ROCKSTAR"** adds a darker, more intense rhythm, creating a diverse foundation for the playlist.

**2. Finding Candidates**

I applied several criteria to identify a pool of over 20 candidate tracks, ensuring a mix of familiar hits and lesser-known tracks:

**Popularity:** Songs with a popularity score of 80 or higher were included to ensure mainstream appeal.

**Key & Tempo:** Tracks that shared a similar key and tempo were selected to guarantee smooth transitions and maintain the energy flow.

**Anchor Artist:** Additional songs by **The Weeknd** and **DaBaby** were included to retain stylistic continuity and cater to fan favorites.

**Release Year & Features:** I prioritized tracks released in the same year as the anchors, considering attributes like acousticness, danceability, and loudness to maintain an era-specific feel.

**Mood & Energy Clustering:** Songs were clustered based on mood-related features like energy, valence, and instrumentalness, ensuring a consistent emotional tone.

**Outcome:** This process resulted in a curated pool of 20+ tracks, each selected based on one or more of the criteria above. The balance of popular hits and undiscovered gems ensures an engaging listening experience.

**3. Curated Playlist (12 Songs)**

From the candidate pool, I selected 12 tracks to create a balanced mix of familiarity and novelty:

**Discovery:** At least 2 tracks were new to me, offering a fresh listening experience.

**Non-Popular:** I made sure to include at least 3 songs with a popularity score below 50, bringing diversity to the playlist.

The final order of the songs was determined by aligning their tempo, key, and energy levels, creating a seamless and engaging narrative flow.

**4. Energy Flow Visualization**

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Code"
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ggplot(playlist_metrics, aes(x = name, y = energy, fill = energy)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Energy Rollercoaster of The Ultimate Workout Journey",
    x = "Track Order",
    y = "Energy"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(color = "black", size = 10), 
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```



**Insight:** üé¢\
The chart mimics a rollercoaster ride, emphasizing the deliberate peaks and valleys in energy.
Each bar‚Äôs percentage label highlights how each track contributes to the dynamic arc, making the structure both clear and engaging.

**Statistical & Visual Analysis**

To build and validate this playlist, I combined rigorous data analysis with clear visual storytelling:

**Data-Driven Selection:** Leveraged audio features (energy, tempo, danceability) extracted from Spotify‚Äôs API and playlist co-occurrence rates to rank and filter over 20,000 tracks. These metrics ensured each candidate complemented the anchor songs on a sonic level.

**Discovery Thresholds:** Applied a popularity cutoff (\<50) to designate tracks as ‚Äúunder-the-radar.‚Äù This rule introduced fresh discoveries‚Äî3 of which made the final 12‚Äîand prevented the list from skewing too mainstream.\*\*

**Order Optimization:** Algorithmically sorted candidates by energy progression and tempo compatibility, then manually fine-tuned the sequence to optimize listener engagement. This hybrid approach balances quantitative precision with human judgment.

**Visual Validation:** Charted the energy trajectory across the final playlist. The plot‚Äôs peaks and valleys visually confirm:

***A strong opening to hook listeners***

***Mid-playlist troughs that spotlight lesser-known gems***

***A climactic rise for an invigorating finish***

**Reader-Friendly Interpretation:** The annotated bar chart not only displays energy values but also highlights which tracks meet each design principle (e.g., discovery vs. familiarity), making the analysis accessible at a glance.

Together, these statistical methods and visual checks demonstrate why this playlist earns the title ‚ÄúUltimate‚Äù by delivering both reliability (through data) and delight (through curated surprises).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üèÅ Conclusion

**"The Ultimate Workout Journey"** playlist blends data an alysis with creative curation to craft an engaging listening experience. By applying heuristics like playlist co-occurrence, key and tempo matching, and mood clustering, the playlist balances popular hits with hidden gems to ensure both familiarity and discovery.
